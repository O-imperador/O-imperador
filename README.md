## About Me
I enjoy exploring multiple fields—**AI, data science, cloud computing, full-stack development, DevOps, and IoT**.  
I aim to understand the **intersections between technologies** to build a coherent, versatile skill set.  

I believe in learning by doing, experimenting with real-world or experimental projects, and connecting concepts across domains to **create meaningful solutions**.
