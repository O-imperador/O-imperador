### 🧭 My Learning Journey
I’m currently exploring multiple fields—**DevOps, cloud computing, AI, data science, full-stack web development, IoT, networking, and more**. This exploration is part of my journey to discover what truly aligns with my interests and strengths.

I’ve realized that I’m genuinely interested in whatever field I start exploring, but I also understand that to gain deep expertise, I need to focus on **one or two areas** and master them.

History shows that it’s possible to excel in multiple domains when their connections are understood. For example, polymaths like **Ibn Sina (Avicenna)** were simultaneously physicians, philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists—he didn’t just accumulate unrelated skills, he **connected them into a coherent understanding of the world**. Similarly, I aim to explore different fields while looking for the **intersections that link them together**, so I can eventually learn them as a unified, versatile discipline.

This mindset guides how I explore technology and knowledge, helping me **connect the dots** and gradually build a meaningful, versatile skill set.
